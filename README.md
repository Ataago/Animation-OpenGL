Smart Watch Advertisement Animation using OpenGL.
	Wearable computers are expected to become the next big thing but popular press is divided on whether they will be successful. In this paper we review the existing literature on one type of wearable - smartwatches - and extend their definition, in addition to highlighting the need to understand users' everyday appropriation of these technologies. We present initial findings from an on going interview study with ten early adopters that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate why and how people use smartwatches in real life. We describe everyday use of smartwatches, highlight the added value seen by users, and identify the limitations to mass adoption as expressed by current users.

# Benefits
These are some of the points how Education can benefit with Smart Watches.
- Get Real time notifications about classes and exams: Android Wear powered smart watches can be connected with school management apps that will notify students of classes in a day and changes in schedules in real time.
-  Assist teachers in marking attendance: Apps for the school management systems can integrate with Android Wear and assist teachers to mark student attendance by tracking student presence in a classroom.
-  Plan daily study routines during class: With the easy access that these devices provide students can immediately note down and plan activities & assignments created by teachers in classes.
- Keep track of fitness during exercise/games: With inbuilt sensors in the devices, students can keep track of their workout in school games/gym and school physical instructors can plan specific regimens for their students using this data.
- Voice Recording: Students can record lectures right from the Android Wear without fumbling with recording devices and later transfer to their phones or PCs for future reference.
